Build a GIF animation library, such that a user can search a GIF by keyword or select from a gallery. Upon selecting a GIF, it should be displayed in a Pop-up window (modal) with options to share or download the GIF.

Upon sharing or download action, user can be given the option to trim the GIF animations to specific number of frames (implement this feature), once they are done trimming the GIF, they should be able to save it to their computer.
